## [Unreleased]

#### Added
 - Added new methods `Scalar.from_int_nonzero_checked` and `Scalar.from_bytes_nonzero_checked`
   that ensure a constructed scalar is in the range `0 < s < N` (i.e. is non-zero and within the
   group order) and throw a `ValueError` otherwise. This is e.g. useful for ensuring that newly
   generated secret keys or nonces are valid without having to do the non-zero check manually.
   The already existing methods `Scalar.from_int_checked` and `Scalar.from_bytes_checked` error
   on overflow, but not on zero, i.e. they only ensure `0 <= s < N`.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-03-31
